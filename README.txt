This project should contain everything you need to build and run CVFunhouse under Xcode 4.3.3.  If you run into any problems building or running, please file a bug.

To get started writing your own OpenCV code, try modifying the CVFPassThru example.  It contains thorough comments explaining exactly what you need to do.  Plus it starts out working, so you can easily tell if you break anything as you hack.

NOTE: CVFunhouse includes a copy of the OpenCV library in built as an iOS framework.  OpenCV is licensed separately under similar terms.  See the file "OpenCV license.txt" for details.  For more information on OpenCV (including full source code to the library), see http://opencv.org/
